1. Modified `data.js/getMovies` to accept a second parameter `page`; updated `movies.js/catalog` accordingly
2. Added paging query parameters to request - note how they are appended, depending on the existance of search params
3. Current page is obtained from the routing params
4. Added pagination template and referenced it in the controller
